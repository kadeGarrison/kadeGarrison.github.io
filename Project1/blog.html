                I'm going to be 100% honest... I wasn't really sure what to put here.
                I guess I'll use this page to talk about my feelings towards Web App.

                I've only ever expereinced backend work, but after just these few weeks
                of more front end stuff, I love it! It has genuinely opened my eyes to a whole
                new area of code I haven't expereinced before. Something that has peaked my interest
                and something I would definitely consider as a career!
